            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">
                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
                fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order
                to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
                improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly
                different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the
                mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of
                cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex
                vocational skills.

            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">
                Digital Transformation involves improving the core business processes of a company to effectively
                fulfill customer expectations through data and technology leveraging. In the educational sector,
                students, faculty, staff and graduates can be the target consumer and both students and professors can
                benefit from digital transformation in schools.

                Digital transformation to enhance student experience may include:

                Enabling students to enter through the mobile app or web application.
                Providing a broad range of choices for online learning.
                Using technology to track the progress of students and enforce intervention protocols.
                Enabling online class organization faculties.

            <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">
                Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in
                impoverished areas and developing countries. However, lack of technological advancement is still causing
                barriers with regards to quality and access to education in developing countries.[110] Charities like
                One Laptop per Child are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may
                access educational material.The OLPC foundation, a group out of MIT Media Lab and supported by several
                major corporations, has a stated mission to dand Internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning
                directly to its students. In 2004, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched EDUSAT, a
                communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's
                population at a greatly reduced costIndia is developing technologies that will bypass land-based
